# Future Roadmap: Vastu AI v2.0 & Beyond

This document outlines the planned trajectory for Vastu AI, covering immediate technical debt, feature enhancements, and long-term visionary goals.

## 1. Immediate Technical Improvements (v1.1)
*   **Backend Logic Sync**: The frontend now sends rich data (Lifestyle, detailed room sizes), but the backend `rule_engine.py` currently uses a simplified logic. We need to update the allocator to respect these weights (e.g., if "Kitchen Priority" is High, prioritize SE corner over all else).
*   **Error Handling**: Improve resilience against "Impossible Constraints" (e.g., small plot + too many rooms). The system should return a "Best Effort" result with warnings rather than failing or returning overlapping rooms.
*   **PDF Report Polish**: Ensure the PDF generation supports dynamic text length from the AI model (text wrapping, multi-page support).

## 2. Feature Enhancements (v1.2 - v1.5)
### Generative AI Integration
*   **Advanced LLM Support**: Integrate stronger local models (e.g., Llama 3 quantized) or cloud APIs (Gemini Pro/GPT-4o) for deeply personalized architectural advice.
*   **Image Generation**: Move from 2D colored blocks to Stable Diffusion / ControlNet to generate pseudo-realistic top-down renders of the layout.

### User Experience
*   **Interactive Canvas**: Allow users to drag and drop rooms to "tweak" the generated layout. The system should calculate the Vastu Score difference in real-time.
*   **Comparison Mode**: Side-by-side comparison of the 3 generated options with a "Pro/Con" list generated by AI.
*   **Project Saving**: implement LocalStorage or a lightweight SQLite DB to save user designs.

## 3. Future Scope (v2.0)
### Advanced Architecture
*   **Multi-Floor Logic**: True 3D stacking logic for G+1 and G+2, ensuring plumbing alignment (bathrooms over bathrooms) and structural integrity.
*   **DXF/CAD Export**: Generate `.dxf` files so architects can import the layout directly into AutoCAD/Revit.
*   **Solar & Wind Analysis**: Use the "Facing" and "Location" data to simulate sunlight path and airflow, adding scientific layers to the Vastu suggestions.

### Commercial Vastu
*   **Office & Factory Modules**: Different rule sets for commercial properties (e.g., CEO seating, heavy machinery placement).

## 4. Visionary Goals (v3.0+)
*   **3D Walkthrough**: Use Three.js (already in place) to extrude the 2D floor plan into a walkable 3D model directly in the browser.
*   **AR Visualization**: "View on Site" feature using mobile AR to overlay the floor plan on an empty plot of land.
